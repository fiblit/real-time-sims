I used [Glitter](http://polytonic.github.io/Glitter/) to get the boilerplate of OpenGL/GLFW working.

I DID NOT USE bullet or glm because that wouldn't be in the spirit of the homework
I DID NOT USE assimp or stb because I didn't need them
I DID USE glad because I didn't want to deal writing its equivalents.
