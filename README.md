# Real-time simulations

Currently contains mostly homework from the class I took on Real-time Simulations/Rendering and Motion planning in games. (CSCI 5611)
Please note that I still mean to finish HW3, a water simulation. Also, please note that many of the 5611 projects made use of a slightly more developed form of my "gg-engine" project. gg-engine fell by the wayside in favor of particular specialized modules I made in each homework. I wanted gg to be developed the right way, so I left it on the backburner.
